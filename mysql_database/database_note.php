/* five types of index 

index, unique, primary => common use
fulltext, spatial => rare use 

In each table there is only one primary index 
but there can be more than one unique index 

if you want to set some thing as primary index then you should set that to id in database 

//how to connect data base with php

// what is PDO class ? PDO => extension for php to connect it with database
when we install xampp PDO is already in it .
